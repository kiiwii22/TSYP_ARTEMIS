## Motivation
To really grasp and get hold of the problems that a moon landing presents, we had to take a detailed look at previous Lunar missions.
Looking back at multipule Apollo missions, we've noticed two main inconvinieces that astronauts faced: 

1- The inefficiency of sampling tools: -It took alot of time and effort to breach the moons surface (about 50 hammer blows).
				       -The sample collecting task required two astronauts ( one to collect the samples and the other to hold the sample collection bag).

2- The lack of balance support for astronauts: -The level of gravity on the moon is about 17 percent of Earth's gravity, which is just barely strong enough to provide adequate cues for astronauts to walk proprely .
					       -Space suits are generally heavy and hinder movement causing falls on previous cases.

## Solution
This project presents Scane a HAAS (Human Augmentation and  Assistance System) designed to aid astronauts with sample collecting and balance during their ARTEMIS Moon mission.

- Drilling - Allowing more access to deeper test peices of the moon.
- Suction - Automating the storing of samples.
- Storing - External bag making sampling a one man job.
- Human Machine interface - Easy control and monitoring of the gadget.
