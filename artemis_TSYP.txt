-previous inconveniences in Apollo missons:
     .various equipments that are considered primitive and that are  hard to use especially with a space suit on
       (ex.  core tubes that were used to obtain samples from below the moon surface required about 50 hammer blows )
        
      .During apollo mission two astronauts had to 
        work  close to one another  because they     
         had to  store their findings in each other's 
        sample bag ( due to limited flexibility of the 
        space suit)
